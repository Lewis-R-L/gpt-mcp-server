As students proceed through the assessment, the difficulty of the following questions will be adapted based on the previous responses. By offering multiple questions targeted at the student’s level, the assessment can accurately evaluate students’ abilities very quickly. Additionally, the psychometrics used in the scoring algorithm can control for lucky guesses or inadvertent errors that deviate from the expected response model. Once the algorithm is confident in the student’s ability, the assessment ends and the student will receive a score.',
  ILA035: 'Speaking Test',
  ILA036:
    "Our fully-automated speaking assessment utilizes artificial intelligence to evaluate students’ speaking ability through the use of innovative linguistic methods, such as elicited imitation (EI). Elicited imitation, which is a fancy way to say “listen and repeat”, is a research-proven method to efficiently predict test-takers' oral language proficiency. It measures how effectively test-takers' brains can process or “chunk” language information. Higher proficiency in the language enables a test-taker to process longer and more complex sentences.",

All paid lessons on italki count, including trial and group classes.\n\nDo I have to pay for lessons?\nYes. All lessons during the challenge must be paid and taken on italki.\n\nDo longer lessons earn more drops?\nNo. Every completed lesson earns the same amount of Water Drops, regardless of duration.\n\nIf I’m learning multiple languages, do I need more than one fish?\nYes. You’ll name one fish for each language you’re learning during the challenge.\n\nHow are Water Drops counted if I learn multiple languages?\nYour total drop count is the sum of drops across all languages you're learning.\n\nWhy aren’t all my drops counted on the global ranking leaderboard?\nDrops obtained through three specific actions—adopting new fish, reviving fish, and receiving login rewards after 14 days of inactivity—are excluded from the campaign ranking.\n\n\nWhy am I ranked lower/higher than other challengers even though I've collected the same amount of water drops?\nChallengers are ranked by water drops and sign up time. If you are ranked higher but have the same water drops as someone else, it means you signed up before the challengers below you.\n\n <a target='_blank' href='https://support.italki.com/hc/en-us/articles/48312835234713-How-does-the-italki-fish-work'>👉 More details How Water Drops work</a>.",

    "Benny Lewis used to be just like most of us fluent in just one language but with a nagging desire to learn more. After university he moved to Spain to try and pick up Spanish but found himself no more fluent after six months than he'd been when he arrived. Frustrated he decided to put his background in electrical engineering to good use by developing a method that broke down language learning into universal milestones focusing on acquisition through regular conversation. And this is where Language Hacking began!",
